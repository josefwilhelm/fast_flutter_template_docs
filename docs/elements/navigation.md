# Navigation

The navigation is built with [auto_route](https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route). You can find the routes in the `lib/app_router.dart` file.

Reasons for using auto_route:
- Strongly typed routes
- Code generation (as I use it already with Riverpod and Freezed)
- Really good deep linking support
- Route guards are easy to implement
- Good documentation

I've been using auto_route for 3 years now, even before go_router was a real thing. I'm very happy with it and never had any issues.
Here is a reddit post where some problems of go_router are discussed: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev/comments/w2om0z/gorouter_or_autoroute/)


P.S. 
I will try to look into go_router again if that's what the community wants. Just let me know on Discord.
