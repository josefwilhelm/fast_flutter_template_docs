# FVM

Fvm is a handy version management tool for Flutter.

This will help you switch between Flutter versions and manage Flutter SDK versions per project.
This might sound abstract, here is an example:

Let's say you have a project that uses Flutter 3.3.4, and you want to upgrade to the latest Flutter version 3.13.9. You can use FVM to install Flutter 3.13.9 and run `fvm use 3.13.9` in your project directory. This will make your project use Flutter 3.13.9.

Here is the [official documentation](https://fvm.app/docs/getting_started/installation) for FVM.
